I'll be on vacation from Tuesday, June 27th until 2 days ago.

00:00:08.765 --> 00:00:10.814
Um, your auto-response is still on.

00:00:10.814 --> 00:00:15.325

Will do, Tripp.

00:00:29.815 --> 00:00:31.360
Will do, Tripp.

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:33.137
- Will do, Tripp.

00:00:33.137 --> 00:00:36.218
Why are you including me in this?

00:00:37.136 --> 00:00:39.784
Be there around 7 tonight, if that's okay?

00:00:39.784 --> 00:00:41.281
Yeah, sounds good.

00:00:41.281 --> 00:00:55.150

00:01:04.427 --> 00:01:07.490
Here's that report you needed.

00:01:09.962 --> 00:01:11.225
I don't see anything.

00:01:11.225 --> 00:01:15.017
Oh, dang it. I forgot to attach it.

00:01:15.017 --> 00:01:17.557
Hey, Beth, did you see all of the submissions we got today?

00:01:17.557 --> 00:01:19.141
OMG, I KNOW!

00:01:19.141 --> 00:01:20.678
Easy on the all caps.

00:01:20.678 --> 00:01:21.455
Sorry.

00:01:21.455 --> 00:01:24.148
It's okay. Semi-colon. Closed parentheses.

00:01:24.148 --> 00:01:31.841
Hey, son. You have to watch this video of this cat sleeping on a horse. It is so cute!

00:01:31.841 --> 00:01:33.214
Mom, I'm at work!

00:01:33.214 --> 00:01:40.603
Dear friend, I am Johnson Emmanuel. This might come to you as a surprise. I am the next heir to the throne in

00:01:40.603 --> 00:01:43.614
Nigeria and I want to offer you a large sum of money.

00:01:43.614 --> 00:01:44.825
Please stop coming here.

00:01:44.825 --> 00:01:49.285
Hi, Tripp. Are you satisfied with-

00:01:49.285 --> 00:01:57.174
Hi. I'm the administrator. I cannot deliver this document. It was too big. On Monday at 10:37am, Paul

00:01:57.174 --> 00:02:01.110
wrote, "Hi, Tripp. This is the latest version of the document you were looking for. Hope it's not too late.

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:02.169
Paul."

00:02:02.169 --> 00:02:03.043
Yeah, I know what I wrote.

00:02:03.043 --> 00:02:09.731
Hey, really looking forward to seeing you guys tonight. Oh yeah, circular disclosure: this information

00:02:09.731 --> 00:02:15.182
transmitted just now is intended only for the person or entity to which it is addressed. It may contain

00:02:15.182 --> 00:02:19.304
confidential and/or privileged material. Any review, retransmission-

00:02:19.304 --> 00:02:20.178
I don't know what that means.

00:02:22.721 --> 00:02:24.634
Inbox full.

00:02:28.736 --> 00:02:32.771
Hey, what's this poker game I hear about this weekend?

00:02:32.771 --> 00:02:33.815
Who's that guy?

00:02:33.815 --> 00:02:35.389
You need me to bring anything, or-

00:02:35.389 --> 00:02:40.728
I meant to invite a different David. Raincheck?

00:02:40.728 --> 00:02:46.545
Email can be frustrating, but that's probably because you're trying to use it for the wrong things, like

00:02:46.545 --> 00:02:51.433
status reporting or approval tracking. If you're looking for a smarter way to manage work, consider using

00:02:51.433 --> 00:02:54.861
WorkFront, a much better than email approach to work management.
