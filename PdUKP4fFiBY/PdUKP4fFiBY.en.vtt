00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.644
So, if you can just use one of these.

00:00:01.644 --> 00:00:04.008
Whoa, you've got a huge dongle.

00:00:04.008 --> 00:00:07.508
Thanks. It gets the job done, I guess.

00:00:07.508 --> 00:00:08.524
I've seen bigger.

00:00:09.837 --> 00:00:11.617
I have a really small one.

00:00:11.617 --> 00:00:14.148
Well, mine's normal size, but it doesn't work like it used to.

00:00:14.148 --> 00:00:16.759
Hey guys, what is going on in there?

00:00:16.759 --> 00:00:19.138
Presentation. Paul tried to get his up.

00:00:19.138 --> 00:00:20.979
Tripp, I think yours is too wide.

00:00:20.979 --> 00:00:21.979
I've got two.

00:00:21.979 --> 00:00:23.367
Can you use them at the same time?

00:00:23.367 --> 00:00:24.946
Hmm, never tried it.

00:00:24.946 --> 00:00:26.060
Has anyone seem mine?

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:27.638
It's resting on top of the sac.

00:00:27.638 --> 00:00:32.259
Tripp, is your more wider than it is long? I've never seen that before.

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:33.511
Wait, Tara, do you have one?

00:00:33.511 --> 00:00:35.367
Yeah, but it's at home in my drawer.

00:00:35.367 --> 00:00:36.777
You know, mine was like this once.

00:00:36.777 --> 00:00:37.838
Mine bends to the left.

00:00:37.838 --> 00:00:39.493
Whoa, I think you're stepping on mine.

00:00:39.493 --> 00:00:40.387
Is your purple?

00:00:40.387 --> 00:00:42.242
Just the top part.

00:00:42.242 --> 00:00:43.934
Actually, Clint, let me hold yours for a second.

00:00:43.934 --> 00:00:44.696
Sure.

00:00:44.696 --> 00:00:46.039
Why is this so hard?

00:00:46.039 --> 00:00:47.682
Did you try taking it out and putting it back in?

00:00:47.682 --> 00:00:48.616
Can you spin it?

00:00:48.616 --> 00:00:48.980
I think it's stuck.

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:51.226
Sometimes, if you jiggle it around a little bit, that helps.

00:00:51.226 --> 00:00:52.123
Push it harder.

00:00:52.123 --> 00:00:55.102
Oh, you've got it in the wrong slot.

00:00:55.102 --> 00:00:56.508
Should I just ram it in there?

00:00:56.508 --> 00:00:59.212
Well, can we just use yours, or you going to sit there and play with it the whole time?

00:00:59.212 --> 00:01:00.477
Alright, fine, but I warned you.

00:01:00.477 --> 00:01:02.058
No, it's upside down.

00:01:02.058 --> 00:01:02.574
Alright.

00:01:02.574 --> 00:01:04.154
When was the last time you used that thing?

00:01:04.154 --> 00:01:06.117
What are you guys doing?

00:01:06.117 --> 00:01:07.841
What?

00:01:07.841 --> 00:01:09.481
It just sounds like you're comparing dongles.

00:01:09.481 --> 00:01:12.462
That sounds dirty.

00:01:12.462 --> 00:01:16.788
You know you don't need those, right? You can connect to the screen wirelessly. It's a zoom

00:01:16.788 --> 00:01:17.556
room.

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:21.998
Alright. Pull it out.

00:01:27.171 --> 00:01:27.990
Doug, you there?

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:29.109
Doug man?

00:01:29.109 --> 00:01:32.467
I think he hung up.

00:01:32.467 --> 00:01:34.718
Premature evacuation.
